# Pip-Install-Requirements

* The script Pip Install Requirements installs the needed modules from a given project, so it first detects the requirements.txt file in the current working directory.

This Python script has been compiled as a executable file and works on Windows operating systems.
* There is a compiled .exe file you can copy and run it into the directory where you have the files you need to be renamed.



## AI Involvement

The script's development did not depend on AI tools like ChatGPT, their main use was for creating code comments and descriptions.
