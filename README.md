# Pip-Install-Requirements

* The script 'Pip Install Requirements' detects and activates any Python Virtual Environment if one is present in the current working directory.
* It then updates pip itself(Python Package Installer).
* Then the script detects the requirements.txt file in the current working directory and installs the needed modules for a given project.

The purpose of the script is to save time when you need to test multiple Python projects.


This Python script has been compiled as a executable file and works on Windows operating systems.
* There is a compiled .exe file you can copy and run it into the directory where you have the files you need to be renamed.
